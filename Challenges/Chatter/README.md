Challenge: Frontman Badge Test

Your chitter application has been talked about in the internet and people
are raving.

One of the biggest complaints though is that it doesn’t “feel right”. Our
team of social media analysts (SMASS) have found out that the best
course of action to make the next killer social media application
(NEKSMEA) is to work heavily on the front end and create and api for 3rd
parties to connect to our system.

Your task is split into various sub features:

[] skin the application (mainly css and html) so that it finally looks
	 decent ( there is a small competitor of ours, twitter, their ui is quite
	 decent, RECREATE IT!. )
[] make the whole front end work with javascript and a templating
	 system ( like handlebarsjs ) to enrich the experience. Make sure that
	 we only serve one html from our server that will initiate the
[] application.
	 create a JSON API on the server and make the front end talk to that
	 api ( you should create a path like so /api/peep etc ).

Good luck and godspeed!
