The Makers Academy Marketing Array (MAMA) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Our task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web. It needs to have the following features;
- the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

Basic rules;
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
