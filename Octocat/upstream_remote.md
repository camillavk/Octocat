What is the Upstream remote usually used for?

An upstream remote is used when several people are working on code in a repository on Github. The 'upstream' repository is the original repository on Github (hence the word 'remote'). This means that everyone can have access to it.

'upstream' - the parent, or original repository
'remote' - on Github, not locally on your computer
