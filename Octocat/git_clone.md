What does git clone do?

A git clone creates an exact copy of the repository into a new directory. You can clone a git repository into your local directory. This will give you access to the entire history of the code and will allow you to make changes to it, that you can later push back.

When you clone a repository it will clone all the remote branches, but will put them all into one local branch (master).
