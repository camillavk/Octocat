What is a git branch?

When you create a new branch, it essentially takes a 'snapshot' of where you are on your master branch. If you then change into this new branch you can make changes to the code and continue developing it, without affecting the original master branch. 

This means you can play around with the code until you are sure it does what you want and only then merge the branch back to the master branch. When you merge a branch back to the master branch it will implement all the changes you made onto the master branch.
